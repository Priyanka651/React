# React

# ⚛️ What is React?

## 📖 Introduction
**React** is a popular **JavaScript library** for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It was developed by **Facebook (now Meta)** and is widely used for creating single-page applications (SPAs).

## 🚀 Why Use React?
React is known for its:
- **Component-Based Architecture** 🏗️ - Reusable UI components for modular development.
- **Virtual DOM** ⚡ - Faster rendering by updating only necessary parts of the UI.
- **Declarative UI** 🎨 - Describes the UI state, and React updates it efficiently.
- **Hooks & State Management** 🔄 - Efficient handling of UI logic without class components.

## 🔹 Key Features
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)** - HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.
- **React Components** - Functional & Class-based components.
- **State & Props** - Manage and pass data between components.
- **React Hooks** - `useState`, `useEffect`, and more for handling component logic.
- **React Router** - Navigation for single-page applications.
- **Redux / Context API** - Global state management.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
To start with React, install it using **Create React App**:
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start



npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Here’s a simple Hello World example using React:
```bash
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, World! 🌍</h1>;
}

export default App;
```
